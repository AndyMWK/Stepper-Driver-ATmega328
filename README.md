 # Stepper Motor Controller

 ## Project Objective
 I made this controller to better understand the control of electromechanical devices and learn to create an H-bridge.

 ## Controller Functionality
This controller implements full stepping for a stepper motor using an ATmega328 microcontroller. PWM operation is not yet fully implemented yet. 

 ## Controller Components
The controller consists of a microcontroller (ATmega328 processor), an H-bridge circuit that I made myself, and finally a stepper motor.
